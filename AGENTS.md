# Agent Skills (OpenCode)

This project uses skills installed under `.opencode/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, invoke it with the `skill` tool before acting.
- Skills are located in `.opencode/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- Follow the skill workflow strictly; do not partially apply it.
- Never skip required steps such as spec, plan, or test when a skill demands them.

## Intent → Skill Mapping

Map the user's intent to the matching skill automatically:

- If the user requests unit tests invoke `test-driven-development` skill

## Execution Model

For every request:

1. Determine if any skill applies (even a small chance).
2. Load the skill with `skill({ name: "<skill-name>" })`.
3. Follow the skill workflow exactly.
4. Only proceed to implementation once required steps are complete.
